## Suitability for UI Automation
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Excels in coding proficiency (SWE-Bench) and reasoning (GPQA), making it better suited for generating accurate and complex UI automation scripts, especially for frameworks like Selenium or Appium. Its lower latency and faster output speed enhance efficiency in iterative testing environments. However, its smaller context window may limit handling of very large test suites, and higher costs could be a concern for extensive usage.
- **GPT-4.1**: Strong in instruction following and cost-effectiveness, with a massive context window ideal for processing large UI test case datasets or detailed specifications. It’s suitable for teams needing to analyze extensive documentation or perform multimodal tasks like visual UI validation. However, its lower coding benchmark score and slower speed may impact performance in complex script generation.

## Recommendation
- **Choose Claude Sonnet 4** for UI automation tasks requiring high coding accuracy, complex reasoning, and low-latency script generation, especially in dynamic or real-time testing scenarios.
- **Choose GPT-4.1** for projects with large datasets, cost constraints, or a need for strong instruction adherence in standardized UI automation workflows.
